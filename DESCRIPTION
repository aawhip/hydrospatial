Description: An R-package for spatial and temporal analysis of floodplain 
    inundation characteristics and application of habitat suitability criteria.
    It identifies flood events based on one or more floodplain inundation 
    threshold flows and calculates a set of flood event metrics for a given 
    daily flow time series. It takes as input raster data of depth and velocity 
    (e.g., from 2D hydrodynamic modeling) at known flows and a corresponding 
    daily flow time series. Daily rasters of estimated depth and velocity are
    generated from inputs using spatially resolved piece-wise linear 
    interpolation. Hydrospatial analysis functions calculate a range of physical
    metrics using the raster time series. Habitat suitability criteria applied 
    to the computed physical metrics estimate spatially resolved daily cell 
    suitability, allowing for computation of daily weighted usable area. 
    Statistical and graphical summary of these metrics in space and time.
