#' Function to identify flood days and events
#'
#' This function accepts a daily flow time series and a vector of flood
#' thresholds for identifying flood days and determining flood event metrics.
#'
#' @details A daily flow time series data frame is required (as from
#' utils_flowformat function), including the following columns: dt (Date),
#' wyr (water year), wyrd (water year day), flw (flow), cflow (cumulative
#' flow to date), and an_vol (annual volume). Using a single value or vector
#' of flood thresholds, flood days are identified and flood event metrics
#' are determined. Flood event metrics include: cent_d (the water year day
#' at the volume centroid of the flood), pk_d (water year day at the peak
#' flow of the event), no_d (flood event duration in days), no_pks (number
#' of flood peaks), flw_pk (peak daily flow), flw_mean (mean daily flow),
#' vol (volume of flood event, including below-threshold flow), frac_v_cent
#' (number of days to >0.5 of total event volume divided by the total number
#' event days), r_rising (biggest difference in flow between days on the
#' rising limb of hydrograph), r_falling (biggest difference in flow between
#' days on the falling limb of hydrograph. Analysis is the same, regardless
#' of units. Water year is assumed to start on Oct 1.
#'
#' @param d Data frame of daily flow time series
#' @param Q Vector of flow thresholds to use to id flood days
#' @param outdir Directory for writing flows to file
#' @importFrom lubridate month day year mdy ymd
#' @export
#' @return List of 1) flood events, 2) filenames, 3) daily flows with flood id.
#' Writes to file daily and flood event csvs.
